# Chord
This project builds a P2P system, implementing the idea from the paper "Chord: A Scalable Peer-to-peer Lookup Service for Internet Applications"

Usage:
• Run ChordServer.main() and the system initially contains keys ranging from 0 to 255.
• join p – add a node with id p
• show p – show keys stored in node with id p
• show all – call "show p" to each node in the order of ascending id
• find p k - ask node with id p to locate key k
• crash p – destroy node with id p
